  Supports 'Spatial' objects of class 'SpatialPoints',
  'SpatialPointsDataFrame', 'SpatialLines', 'SpatialLinesDataFrame',
  'SpatialPolygons', and 'SpatialPolygonsDataFrame'. Supports 'WKB' geometry
  types 'Point', 'LineString', 'Polygon', 'MultiPoint', 'MultiLineString', and
  'MultiPolygon'. Includes extensions to enable creation of maps with
