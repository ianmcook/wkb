## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Used single quotes for non-English usage in DESCRIPTION
* Used \acronym{text} markup in documentation

## Test environments
* Mac OS X 10.10.5, R-devel
* Mac OS X 10.10.5, R-3.2.2
* Ubuntu 14.04, R-3.2.2
* Windows Server 2008 R2, R-3.2.2

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Geospatial (12:54)
  
This is not a misspelling.
